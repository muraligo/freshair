Ideas and Trials

This is my repository where I can try my ideas, learn new technologies, and share ideas and examples.

I have developed software over the years and have used my own web site to blog about my ideas.
Since so many people use GitHub, I would like people to find my ideas and examples more easily than through my web site.

My key interests are:
* Distributed Computing (especially dynamic load balancing through learning)
* Parallel Execution (especially MIMD architectures and the study of contention patterns)
* Databases (especially understanding which models are better in which cases)
* Programming Languages (especially camparison of their features through a mathematical understanding of their semantics)
